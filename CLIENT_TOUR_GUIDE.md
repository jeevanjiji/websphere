# Client Tour & Simplified Project Posting Guide

## 🎯 What's New

### 1. **Guided Tour for New Clients**
- **Automatic Tour**: New clients see an interactive tour on their first dashboard visit
- **Manual Tour**: Clients can restart the tour anytime by clicking the "Help Tour" button in the navbar
- **Tour Highlights**: Welcome message, project posting, navigation tabs, project cards, notifications, and user menu

### 2. **Simplified Project Posting Form**
The complex project posting form has been completely redesigned for better user experience:

#### **Removed Complex Features:**
- ❌ Skill tags (too technical for average users)
- ❌ Complex category descriptions with technical jargon
- ❌ Advanced filtering options
- ❌ Technical terminology

#### **New User-Friendly Features:**
- ✅ **Simple Categories**: 6 easy-to-understand options with icons
  - 🌐 Website Development
  - 📱 Mobile App  
  - 🎨 Design Work
  - ✍️ Content Writing
  - 📈 Marketing & SEO
  - 🔧 Other Services

- ✅ **Budget Ranges**: Pre-defined ranges instead of complex inputs
  - Rs.500 - Rs.2,000 (Small project)
  - Rs.2,000 - Rs.10,000 (Medium project)  
  - Rs.10,000 - Rs.50,000 (Large project)
  - Rs.50,000+ (Enterprise project)

- ✅ **Plain Language**: All instructions use simple, non-technical language
- ✅ **Visual Design**: Card-based selection with icons and descriptions
- ✅ **Helpful Tips**: Context-sensitive guidance throughout the form

## 🚀 How It Works

### **First-Time User Experience:**
1. Client registers and logs in for the first time
2. After 1.5 seconds on the dashboard, the tour automatically starts
3. Tour walks through all key features with helpful explanations
4. Tour completion is saved - won't show again automatically

### **Returning Users:**
- Can manually trigger tour by clicking "Help Tour" in the navbar
- Tour button only visible to clients (not freelancers or admins)

### **Tour Steps:**
1. **Welcome**: Introduction to the dashboard
2. **Post Project**: How to create new projects
3. **Navigation**: Understanding the tab system
4. **Project Cards**: Managing existing projects
5. **Notifications**: Staying updated on applications
6. **User Menu**: Profile and account settings
